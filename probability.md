Important Rules:
  * The Rule of Sum explains how to find the probablilty that at least one of two events occurs. When two events are mutually exclusive (cannot occur simultaneously) the Rule of Sum is:
    * P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
      * Another way to write this is as: P(A U B). We read this as the union of A and B. This is all elements found in both sets A and B.
  * The Rule of Product explains how to find the probability that all events occur when the events are independent (mutually exclusive):
    * P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
      * Another way to write this is as: P(A n B). We read this as the intersection of A and B. This is all elements common to both A and B.
  * When two events are not necessarily mutually exclusive, the probability of the union of the two events (via the generalized Rule of Sum) is:
    * P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B). 
      * We could write this as: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
    * This generalized Rule of Sum is known as the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle.
